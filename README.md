# BDIX-Tester
A desktop application for searching BDIX servers (Internet service providers of Bangladesh's shared server)

# Why this fork?
This fork is meant for my personal use by editing the list of BDIX servers according my need. Some of the servers listed in the main repository are not actually BDIX servers. Additionally some renowned servers are also missing from the list like "https://mangogamers.com/".
